# GitHub
**GitHub**¬†is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. Here are the key features and details about GitHub:

1. **Version Control with Git**: GitHub uses Git software, which provides distributed version control. Developers can track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects.
    
2. **Access Control**: GitHub allows fine-grained access control. You can specify who can view, edit, or contribute to your repositories.
    
3. **Bug Tracking and Issue Management**: Developers can report and track bugs, issues, and feature requests within GitHub repositories. This helps streamline collaboration and project management.
    
4. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub integrates with CI tools, allowing automated testing and deployment. When you push code changes, CI pipelines run tests and build processes automatically.
    
5. **Wikis and Documentation**: Each GitHub repository includes a wiki where you can document your project, share instructions, and provide context for contributors.
    
6. **Open Source Hosting**: GitHub is widely used for hosting open source software projects. It provides a central place for collaboration, code review, and community contributions.
    
7. [**Large Developer Community**: As of January 2023, GitHub has over 100 million developers and more than 420 million repositories, including millions of public repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).
    

In summary, GitHub is a powerful platform that facilitates code collaboration, version control, and project management.¬†[Whether you‚Äôre an individual developer or part of a team, GitHub offers essential tools for building and maintaining software projects! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)[2](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/)
